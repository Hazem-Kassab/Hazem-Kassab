- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hazem-Kassab, a structural engineer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in subjects related to computational mechanics and finite element analysis, and I am willing to collaborate in such projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning books "Mechanics of Elastic Structures/ Stability of Structures: Elastic, Inelastic, Failure and Damage Theories/ Fundamentals of Structural Mechanics"
and later will implement this knowledge and build libraries.
- ðŸ“« if you are interested in my repositories and want to collaborate you can reach me via Hazem_Kassab@hotmail.com
